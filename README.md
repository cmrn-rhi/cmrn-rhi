### Hello!

Rhiannon here. I am a graduate student researcher at [The Centre for Infectious Disease Genomics and One Health](cidgoh.ca) (CIDGOH) under the supervision of Dr. William Hsiao.
I originally joined the lab with the intention of developing microbial genomic pipelines, but soon found myself falling head over heals into the rabbit hole of ontologies. While I still dabble in genomics related work on the side, my primary focus is the curation and development of ontologies for public health outbreak investigations and surveillance. 

- I'm currently working on ontologizing the [CanCOGeN Contextual Data Specification](https://github.com/Public-Health-Bioinformatics/DataHarmonizer/wiki/CanCOGeN-Contextual-Data-Specification) and integrating it into the contextual data\* harmonization tool [The DataHarmonizer](https://github.com/Public-Health-Bioinformatics/DataHarmonizer).
- The aforementioned is being housed in the [Genomic Epidemiology Ontology](https://genepio.org/) (GenEpiO), where I also look forward to integrating future PhD thesis work (project details to come after proposal approval) :crossed_fingers:.
- I previously worked as a data curator on the farm to fork food ontology [FoodON](foodon.org) and still regularly participate developer meetings, jummping in on the occasional project/issue when I have time.
- I'm always keen to collaborate with others and actively participate in the [OBOFoundry](http://www.obofoundry.org/) community.
- Lastly, I am an advocate of [FAIR Principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) - Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse of digital assets - and do my best to apply these principles in my work.
